**OVERVIEW**
Welcome to my app named "Nonstop". My app is a music-based app whose use is to create playlists that will help people to enjoy life with their favorite songs. The inspiration I got while making this app was the nights that were too quiet, or the days that were too long, or even when life doesn't go our way. At least we know that music and the right playlist won't let us down.

**Purpose:** The purpose of my app is to make life easier for others by allowing them to easily create the playlist of their dreams. My app is the proof that even on bad days, music will always be food for the soul.

**Features**:

- This is my main screen. This is where our listeners are able to enter the songs of their choice. They can enter the song, the artist that made the song, the rating of the song, and even add comments to their playlist or to differentiate between playlists. From the information on the songs that they have given us, we can lead them to a page to see the songs that they have chosen or allow them to add more songs by a touch of a button. There is also an exit button that allows the listener to exit the app without any fuss.

- This is my display screen. This is where the listeners can see their beloved songs with the corresponding details that they have provided to the app. The listeners can even calculate the average rating of the song; it calculates it in a loop. This screen even has a return-to-home-screen button so that the listener can go back to the home screen to add any songs that they feel are missing.
